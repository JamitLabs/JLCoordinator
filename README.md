## Environment/Build Configurations

## SwiftLint und Swiftgen configuration
The configuration files for swiftgen and swiftlint are stored in a separate [repository](https://git.jamitlabs.net/jamit-labs/iOS/project-configuration-files). They have to be added as git submodule.
If not already included open terminal and go to project root folder. Execute following command:

```
git submodule add git@git.jamitlabs.net:jamit-labs/iOS/project-configuration-files.git

If changes of the configuration are necessary please create a project branch in the configuration repository and discuss the rules with the team if they should be added to the base configuration.
